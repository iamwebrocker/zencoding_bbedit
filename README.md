zencoding_bbedit
================

Modification of [Kendall Conrad's Zen-Coding plugin for BBEdit](http://www.angelwatt.com/coding/zen-coding_bbedit.php), uses [BBEdit's new "package" format (available since version 10)](http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/arch_bbedit10.html)

To install, simply look for a directory "Packages" inside your ~/Library/Application Support/BBedit/ directory, and copy the directory "zencoding_(version).bbpackage" there. If no "Packages" directory exists, create it first, then copy.
